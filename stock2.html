            <h5>What is a Stock Exchange?</h5>
            <p>A stock exchange is a regulated marketplace where securities such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives are
              bought and sold. It provides a structured environment for trading and ensures transparency, fairness, and
              liquidity in the securities market. In India, the major stock exchanges are the Bombay Stock Exchange
              (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).</p>

            <h5>How Stock Exchanges Operate</h5>
            <h6>Trading Mechanism</h6>
            <p>Stock exchanges use various trading systems, such as electronic trading platforms, to facilitate buy and
              sell orders. Orders are matched using algorithms that ensure efficient execution.</p>

            <h6>Clearing and Settlement</h6>
            <p>After a trade is executed, the clearing process ensures that the trade is confirmed and settled. This
              involves the transfer of securities and funds between the buyer and seller. The National Securities
              Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) and the Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) handle clearing
              and settlement in India.</p>

            <h6>Listing Requirements</h6>
            <p>Companies must meet specific criteria to be listed on a stock exchange, including minimum financial
              thresholds, corporate governance standards, and disclosure requirements. Listing provides companies with
              access to a broad investor base and helps raise capital for growth.</p>

            <h6>Regulation and Compliance</h6>
            <p>Stock exchanges work with regulatory bodies like SEBI to enforce rules and regulations that ensure fair
              trading practices. This includes monitoring trading activities, preventing market manipulation, and
              protecting investor interests.</p>
